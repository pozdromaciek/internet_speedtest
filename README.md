# internet_speedtest
Automated Internet Speed Test generating CSV output file and graph.

You can set intervals between test, script will prompt for this.

## Backstory
I was looking for some Speed Test tool that will do tests on desired interval and save results to file, because I just got new internet and wanted to try the speeds to make sure ISP is not bullshitting. Couldn't find any app that fits my requirements (maybe I'm just bad at searching), so I created simple script. Then I added graph to visualise internet speed. You might find this script useful.

## Installation
You need libs from requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to use
Please run the script as Administartor of you're getting Access Denied error.
