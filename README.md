# Internet Speed Test
An automated Internet Speed Test script that generates a CSV output file and graph.

You can customize test intervals; the script will prompt you for this information.

## Background
While searching for a Speed Test tool that could perform tests at desired intervals and save results to a file, I couldn't find an application that met my requirements. Perhaps my searching skills are lacking, so I decided to create a simple script. Later, I added a graph to visualize internet speed. You may find this script useful for monitoring your internet speeds.

## Installation
Ensure you have the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.tx
